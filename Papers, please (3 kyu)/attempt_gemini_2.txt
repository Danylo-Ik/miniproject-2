Objective
Your task is to create a constructor function (or class) and a set of instance methods to perform the tasks of the border checkpoint inspection officer. The methods you will need to create are as follow:
Method: receive_bulletin
Each morning you are issued an official bulletin from the Ministry of Admission. This bulletin will provide updates to regulations and procedures and the name of a wanted criminal.
The bulletin is provided in the form of a string. It may include one or more of the following:
Updates to the list of nations (comma-separated if more than one) whose citizens may enter (begins empty, before the first bulletin):
Updates to required documents
Updates to required vaccinations
Update to a currently wanted criminal
Method: inspect
Each day, a number of entrants line up outside the checkpoint inspection booth to gain passage into Arstotzka. The inspect method will receive an object representing each entrant's set of identifying documents. This object will contain zero or more properties which represent separate documents. Each property will be a string value. These properties may include the following:
Applies to all entrants:
passport
certificate_of_vaccination
Applies only to citizens of Arstotzka
ID_card
Applies only to foreigners:
access_permit
work_pass
grant_of_asylum
diplomatic_authorization
The inspect method will return a result based on whether the entrant passes or fails inspection:
Conditions for passing inspection
All required documents are present
There is no conflicting information across the provided documents
All documents are current (ie. none have expired) -- a document is considered expired if the expiration date is November 22, 1982 or earlier
The entrant is not a wanted criminal
If a certificate_of_vaccination is required and provided, it must list the required vaccination
A "worker" is a foreigner entrant who has WORK listed as their purpose on their access permit
If entrant is a foreigner, a grant_of_asylum or diplomatic_authorization are acceptable in lieu of an access_permit. In the case where a diplomatic_authorization is used, it must include Arstotzka as one of the list of nations that can be accessed.
If the entrant passes inspection, the method should return one of the following string values:
If the entrant is a citizen of Arstotzka: Glory to Arstotzka.
If the entrant is a foreigner: Cause no trouble.
If the entrant fails the inspection due to expired or missing documents, or their certificate_of_vaccination does not include the necessary vaccinations, return Entry denied: with the reason for denial appended.
If the entrant fails the inspection due to mismatching information between documents (causing suspicion of forgery) or if they're a wanted criminal, return Detainment: with the reason for detainment appended.
