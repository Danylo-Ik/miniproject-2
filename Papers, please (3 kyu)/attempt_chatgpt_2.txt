In Python write an Inspector class with these methods: receive_bulletin(bulletin: str)(the bulletin will be provided in a form of string. It may include one or more of the following: Updates to the list of nations, Updates to required documents, Updates to required vaccinations, Update to a currently wanted criminal), inspect(eceive an object representing each entrant's set of identifying documents. Each property will be a string value. These properties may include the following: Applies to all entrants: passport, certificate_of_vaccination; Applies only to citizens of Arstotzka: ID_card; Applies only to foreigners: access_permit, work_pass, grant_of_asylum, diplomatic_authorization). If the entrant passes inspection, the method should return one of the following string values: If the entrant is a citizen of Arstotzka: Glory to Arstotzka. If the entrant is a foreigner: Cause no trouble. If the entrant fails the inspection due to expired or missing documents, or their certificate_of_vaccination does not include the necessary vaccinations, return Entry denied: with the reason for denial appended. If the entrant fails the inspection due to mismatching information between documents (causing suspicion of forgery) or if they're a wanted criminal, return Detainment: with the reason for detainment appended.
