In Python write an Inspector class with these methods: receive_bulletin, inspect. 

receive_bulletin(bulletin: str). It may include one or more of the following: Updates to the list of nations(There are a total of 7 countries: Arstotzka, Antegria, Impor, Kolechia, Obristan, Republia, and United Federation. example 1: Allow citizens of Obristan; example 2: Deny citizens of Kolechia, Republia), Updates to required documents(example 1: Foreigners require access permit; example 2: Citizens of Arstotzka require ID card; example 3: Workers require work pass), Updates to required vaccinations(example 1: Citizens of Antegria, Republia, Obristan require polio vaccination; example 2: Entrants no longer require tetanus vaccination), Update to a currently wanted criminal(example 1: Wanted by the State: Hubert Popovic)

Conditions for passing inspection

All required documents are present
There is no conflicting information across the provided documents
All documents are current (ie. none have expired) -- a document is considered expired if the expiration date is November 22, 1982 or earlier
The entrant is not a wanted criminal
If a certificate_of_vaccination is required and provided, it must list the required vaccination
A "worker" is a foreigner entrant who has WORK listed as their purpose on their access permit
If entrant is a foreigner, a grant_of_asylum or diplomatic_authorization are acceptable in lieu of an access_permit. In the case where a diplomatic_authorization is used, it must include Arstotzka as one of the list of nations that can be accessed.

If the entrant passes inspection, the method should return one of the following string values: If the entrant is a citizen of Arstotzka: Glory to Arstotzka. If the entrant is a foreigner: Cause no trouble. 

If the entrant fails the inspection due to expired or missing documents, or their certificate_of_vaccination does not include the necessary vaccinations, return Entry denied: with the reason for denial appended(Example 1: Entry denied: passport expired.
Example 2: Entry denied: missing required vaccination.
Example 3: Entry denied: missing required access permit.).
 
If the entrant fails the inspection due to mismatching information between documents (causing suspicion of forgery) or if they're a wanted criminal, return Detainment: with the reason for detainment appended. If due to information mismatch, include the mismatched item. e.g.Detainment: ID number mismatch. If the entrant is a wanted criminal: Detainment: Entrant is a wanted criminal.

Test example:

bulletin = """Entrants require passport
Allow citizens of Arstotzka, Obristan"""

inspector = Inspector()
inspector.receive_bulletin(bulletin)

entrant1 = {
    "passport": """ID#: GC07D-FU8AR
    NATION: Arstotzka
    NAME: Guyovich, Russian
    DOB: 1933.11.28
    SEX: M
    ISS: East Grestin
    EXP: 1983.07.10"""
}

inspector.inspect(entrant1) #=> 'Glory to Arstotzka.'
